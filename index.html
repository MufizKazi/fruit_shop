            <b>Nutrient-rich:</b> Fruits are packed with essential vitamins,
            minerals, and antioxidants that are vital for overall health and
            well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Fiber:</b> Fruits are an excellent source of dietary fiber, which
            promotes digestive health by aiding in regular bowel movements,
            preventing constipation, and supporting a healthy gut microbiome.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Weight management:</b> Fruits are naturally low in calories and
            fat while being high in fiber and water content, making them an
            ideal choice for those looking to manage their weight.
